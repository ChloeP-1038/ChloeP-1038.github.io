          <td>Strike</td>
          <td>Plasma Blast</td>
          <td>Toothless is intelligent, loyal, and fiercely protective. Though initially wary, he forms a deep emotional bond with Hiccup and demonstrates a playful, curious nature. His agility and stealth make him one of the most formidable dragons in the skies.</td>
          <td>Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III</td>

          <td>Stoker</td>
          <td>Monstrous Fire</td>
          <td>Hookfang is aggressive, proud, and a bit of a show-off. He enjoys setting himself on fire and asserting dominance, but he ultimately respects Snotlout’s leadership—when it suits him. Their bond is fiery in more ways than one.</td>

          <td>Magnesium-Fueled Spines</td>
          <td>Stormfly is graceful, clever, and highly responsive to Astrid’s commands. She combines speed with precision and has a strong sense of loyalty. Her playful side emerges in quieter moments, especially when not under pressure.</td>

          <td>Boulder</td>
          <td>Lava Ball</td>
          <td>Meatlug is gentle, affectionate, and surprisingly strong. She’s a cuddler at heart and adores Fishlegs, often responding to his voice with immediate affection. Despite her slow appearance, she’s a powerhouse in battle.</td>
          <td>Fishlegs Ingerman</td>

          <td>Hideous Zippleback</td>
          <td>Gas and Spark</td>
          <td>This two-headed dragon is chaotic, quirky, and constantly bickering with itself. Barf and Belch reflect the personalities of their riders, requiring teamwork and coordination to function. Their unique fire mechanism makes them unpredictable and dangerous.</td>
          <td>Ruffnut and Tuffnut Thorston</td>
